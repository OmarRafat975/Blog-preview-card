```

```css
.container .img {
  position: absolute;
  background-image: url("./assets/images/illustration-article.svg");
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  width: 310px;
  height: 185px;
  margin-top: -14.5rem;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```
